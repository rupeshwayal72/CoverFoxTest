Framework:
---
Hybrid Framework in Selenium is a concept where we are using the advantage of both Keyword driven framework 
as well as Data driven framework. It is an easy to use framework which allows manual testers to create test cases by
just looking at the keywords, test data and object repository without coding in the framework.
Hybrid Test Automation Framework which can be used across different web based applications.
In this approach, the endeavor is to build a lot of applications independent reusable keyword components so that they can directly used for
another web application without spending any extra effort. With this framework in place, whenever we need to automate a web based application,
we would not need to start from scratch, but use the application independent keyword components to the extent possible and create application
specific components for the specific needs.
